<h2>Two Crazy Hybrid Ideas I Had</h2>

<em>I posted these to the EV list in July 2005 ...</em>

<blockquote><tt>
	One idea I was thinking about ages ago was to machine off two
	cylinders of an inline four and attach a big electric motor in
	their place, straight onto the crank.  You'd end up with a small
	<em>[(375 in this case)]</em> parallel twin.  With a regenerative controller,
	the motor could do a lot of the work when taking off, and the
	engine could then take over to recharge the motor ... you'd
	probably need fly-by-wire EFI to hide this behaviour from the
	user though.

	Here's another crazy idea <em>[for turning a bike engine into
	a hybrid]</em>: the BMW airhead motor uses a dry
	clutch, so there should be very little friction with the
	clutch disengaged.  And the clutch spins at engine RPM ... up
	to about 8000rpm.  If you made a spacer to fit between clutch
	and gearbox, and connected your electric motor in there (mount
	it off to one side with a belt drive or something?), you
	could just pull the clutch in to disengage the engine, and your
	motor could drive through the gearbox.  And since it's already
	a shaftie, you don't need to muck around with final drives for
	your <em>[tadpole trike]</em>, just use the BMW single-sided swingarm and bevel
	final drive for your back wheel.
<p>
	The 'airhead' motors vary in size between R45 (450cc) and R100 (1000cc).
	They're aircooled, opposed-twin pushrod engines, although the bigger
	ones have oil coolers too.  For a hybrid, you could make the motor
	a good deal smaller by removing the alternator and starter motor ...
	after all, your main motor will do both those jobs.
<p>
	(I don't know as much about BMW K-series motors, but it's possible
	they'd be even better for your purpose, as they're watercooled and
	more fuel efficient than the old airheads.)
