<h2>What is this rally shit anyway?</h2>

Let's imagine, for the sake of the argument, that you like bikes,
beer and bullshit, and that you're not entirely averse to the
whole camping thing either.  So, what could be better than
riding your bike into the middle of nowhere and then standing
around indulging in beer and bullshit with a bunch of 
likeminded fools?
<p>
(I'm fairly horrified to discover that people have actually read this
page, sometimes more than once.  Now I'm too shy to actually write
anything!)

	<td>
		My first ever rally.  Loosely organized by the unredoubtable
		<A HREF="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~monarchs/">Monarchs</A>,
		and held at Talbotville, the site of an old goldrush town
		and now just an empty clearing by the river.
		<p>	
		Sadly, while exploring coastal Gippsland, the XLV 
		shat fourth gear, and I had to limp her home in 3rd
		and 5th.  Due to work and incompetent mechanics, the
		repair took over a year to complete and I ended up
		missing Dargo 2000.

		2001 saw me heading off to Dargo again, this time 
		skipping the worst of the Gippsland flat by detouring
		via Noojee.  Along the way, Stu gets a flat tyre,
		SOC's KTM starts leaking oil and just as the sun begins
		to set the XLV burns out its 12V wiring, runs down its
		battery and the bike fails to proceed.  Fortunately, it
		rolls to a halt just at the gate of
		<A HREF="http://www.dargo.net/wonp1.htm">Wonangatta Caravan Park</A>, which supplies us with
		beer, accomodation and a garage to fix the bike in the
		next morning.

		SOC seizes his KTM and refuses to talk to me because

		I'm pretty sure this is the year Liam comes along
		an catches a heap of trout in the river.  Well worth
		it, and we cook them in alfoil in the fire with a
		squeeze of lemon.

		"<em>I wonder what the poor people are doing?</em>"
		This year everything goes to plan, except for my
		new 2-1 exhaust boiling the fuel in the fuel
		filter every now and then.  Ooops.  I make it in
		for Friday night this year, wrap the fuel line
		in a beer can and spend a very relaxing Saturday
		by the river ... the other XLV
		owners spend Friday night at Woods Point and
		spend Saturday slogging in overland ... takes
		all types!
		<p>
		Friday night is beautiful, Saturday morning warm
		and sunny, but just as the others arrive from their
		adventure the clouds come over and it starts to rain.
		Then snow.  The offroadisti get the last laugh, as 
		they've fitted knobby tyres and the going is a bit
		easier for them on their way out.

		Phil and I work out a 200km trip to get there via the

		first proper ride since I put the XLV back on the

		one leg longer than the other, confessions of an
		(almost) rally virgin, the "photography only by
		appointment" sidecar, classic.  Not feeling so well
		the next morning though!
