<h3>Z1300 chopper:</h3>

This one is a good example ... that enormous, stupid Z1300 engine out 
on display, a nice balance of black and chrome and a neat, minimal tail.
I like the way you can see right through it on top of the engine
cases.  Must be running pod filters or something.
<p>
The tiny tank is a bit scary though.  I mean, it's a 1300/6!
Maybe you could squeeze a secondary tank under the seat somehow,
but I imagine the space is fairly full of black boxes, battery, etc.

This one really caught my eye, too.  Similarly, this has got the
engine on display and that 'gappy' look.  That seat is maybe a 
tad <u>too</u> minimal though!
<p>
Sadly, all I know about it is that it's a Goldwing, it's in
Dublin (maybe), and it's illegally parked ... <small><tt>;-)</tt></small>

It doesn't have to be sleek or rare or expensive ... even the
humble CX500 has chop potential, in this case into an

Terrifying.
