<h3>Z1300 chopper:</h3>

This one is a good example ... that enormous, stupid Z1300 engine out 
on display, a nice balance of black and chrome and a neat, minimal tail.
I like the way you can see right through it on top of the engine
cases.  Must be running pod filters or something.

The tiny tank is a bit scary though.  I mean, it's a 1300/6!
Maybe you could squeeze a secondary tank under the seat somehow,
but I imagine the space is fairly full of black boxes, battery, etc.

<h3>Rat Wing:</h3>

This one really caught my eye, too.  Similarly, this has got the
engine on display and that 'gappy' look.  That seat is maybe a 
tad <u>too</u> minimal though!

Sadly, all I know about it is that it's a Goldwing, it's in
Dublin (maybe), and it's illegally parked ... <small><tt>;-)</tt></small>

It doesn't have to be sleek or rare or expensive ... even the
humble CX500 has chop potential, in this case into an

Terrifying.
