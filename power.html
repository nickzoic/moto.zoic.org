<h1>Motorcycle Power Connector</h1>

At various times, I've wanted to use lights, tools and battery 
tenders on my bikes. The standard 12V auto outlet is the ungainly 
cigarette lighter socket, which is a very arbitrary standard, and
very poorly designed for motorcycle use.<p>

So I've standardized on a much simpler, cheaper and more robust
connector ... there's no particular reason for anyone else to 
use this standard, but arbitrary is arbitrary:


<h2>The connector</h2>

Nylon, 2 detachable crimp/solder pins.
<p>
<ul>	<li><A HREF="http://www.jaycar.com.au/">Jaycar</A> part no PP-2020
	<li><em>Let me know if there are other suppliers</em></li>
</ul>

The connector itself, being nylon, is rustproof, and I've never had
one of the pins rust/oxidise due to exposure in a few years of 
using these connectors. Current carrying capacity is at least 10
amps.<p>Neither end is easy to short against anything, making it safe
for chargers as well as appliances. There is a little catch to stop
the connector pulling off ... this is weak enough to reliably fail
if you ride off without detaching the cable, or can be easily
removed with a sharp knife.<p>
I've found the pins work very well with auto cable if they are
soldered in place.

<h2>The wiring</h2>

I'll replace this with a diagram some day, honest
<pre>
                       socket             plug
	     FUSE    
BAT+ -------#~~~~#-------@- rounded side   =@------- +ve
                     
BAT- --------------------@= square side    -@------- -ve

                            
@- = male pin
@= = female pin         ________\           _____------
			|       |           |_____    |
			|       |           _____|    |
			|_______|           |____     |
			        /                ------
</pre>

By using this slightly unusual swapped-over-pins configuration 
the connector is less likely to fit things it shouldn't.

<h2>The fuse!</h2>

Don't forget to make sure there is a fuse between the connector
and the battery.<p>
I recommend using a 30A rated fuse carrier close
to the battery, with a 15A fuse in it. The
heavy duty connectors seem to have stronger grip on the
fuse ... light ones can cause the fuse to vibrate and melt
the fuse holder / fuse body.
<p>
If your bike takes glass fuses, maybe something like 
<A HREF="http://www.jaycar.com.au/">Jaycar</A> SZ-2016.
<p>
If your bike takes blade fuses, maybe something like
<A HREF="http://www.jaycar.com.au/">Jaycar</A> SZ-2040 or SZ 2045.
<p>
That way, you can share spare fuses between the power connector
and (eg) the headlight fuse.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Try to get the connector somewhere where it is out of the
weather and doesn't look too ugly.

<h2>Appliances</h2>

I use these connectors on a 12V flouro, a 12V driving light 
(makes a good spotlight), a 10A 13.6V PSU and a battery tender.<p>
I've also made up a long extension cord out of heavy figure-8.

All modifications to your motorcycle and your appliances are
at your own risk.
