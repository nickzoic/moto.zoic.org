<body><h1>R100GS: Custom Polycarbonate Screen</h1>

The stocker just threw turbulence at my head when it was 'up',
and hit the raised bars when it was 'down'.  With a bit of
judicious filing, I modified it so it could go 'up' slightly
further, but that made the turbulence worse.  So, rather than
cut down the stocker, i decided to make a new one from scratch.

Sorry about the ASCII art.  Mounting holes are
13mm, with grommets to fit over the 10mm posts on the fairing, and 
flat bits of aluminium to hold it all in place.  I'll get around to
painting those so they look a bit less lame.
<p>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I rotated the bars forward a bit, which
feels much nicer on the wrists, but I had to
file in a notch for the brake light switch.  The screen now has a 
nice coating of bug guts, too, so my lousy bending is a lot less obvious  ...
but, also, the the polycarb has cracked at the edge of one of the upper
holes, where I drilled it too close to the edge.  It's small enough that
you never really look through it anyway.
<p>
The stocker is about 295mm high in the middle, so this screen is very
almost only half the height ... I'll get around to making a 'real' one if
I decide to keep the fairing.

(it's about 185mm high in the middle in these photos, I trimmed
it down a bit after the Trout Rally)

<h2>Working with Polycarbonate</h2>

I cut it with a coarse hacksaw blade in one of those hobby hacksaw
things, where the blade sticks out past the end.  Kind of a hand-powered
jigsaw.  Worked okay.  I cleaned up the edges, rounded off the corners
and cut out the internal angles with a strange tool which looks
a lot like a cylindrical wood rasp, in the drill press raising the
drill presses platform until the bit went down through the center hole,
and sliding the work into it.  Worked very well.  Covered the shed in
plastic snow.
<p>
Drilled the holes with a 13mm spade bit rather than grinding down a 
twist drill ... that worked well too.
<p>
Bent with a hot air gun, clamping the middle part of the screen down
to a workbench and bending the sides with a sheet-metal working tool.
Very hard to get the whole bend to soften at the same time.  Also, I
didn't dry the polycarb out, which caused it to bubble up in a couple
of small patches.  Need a small oven for the shed!
<p>
There's lots of stuff on the Web about polycarbonate.
