<h3><font color="red">Getting the Engine out!</font></h3>

	The XLV engine is a big lump, and the frame is
	pretty tight around it. The easiest way seems to
	be to lift the frame off the engine.

	<ol>
	<li> Remove the seat, tank, bashplate, pipes, carbs, coils, etc.
	<li> Disconnect the battery earth and the starter motor lead,
		also any other engine wiring (generator, timing coils, 
		oil warning, etc). Remove the battery.
	<li> Remove the left hand lower frame rail.
	<li> Drain oil, remove oil filter and oil cooler, also oil
		breather lines.
		<em>careful! see oil cooler tip below</em>
	<li> Support the bike with a stand (milk crate?) under the
		engine block. Make sure it's narrow enough not to 
		foul the lower frame rails.
	<li> Use a couple of those ratchet tie-downs to steady the
		bike at bars and tail. Tighten them until they 
		start to lift the bike just slightly ... the idea
		being to minimize the side-load on the engine bolts.
	<li> Off with the wheels, forks, final drive. Pull on the
		shaft so the front splines disengage. This prevents
		the weight of the engine settling on the uni joint.
	<li> Remove engine bolts. They won't slide out if there's
		too much side-load, so adjust the tiedowns until 
		they will.
	<li> So now you've got the engine separate from the frame,
		but still inside it. Make one last check that you
		haven't left breather hoses, etc, on.
	<li> Lift the front up the frame up a bit, and guide the
		front head into the front frame opening. You can
		now get the splined driveshaft out of the swingarm,
		and pivot the back of the frame off the motor. Use
		the tiedowns to take the weight of the frame, and
		just swing it out of the way.
	</ol> 

	As always, putting the motor back in is the same, in
	reverse, only more frustrating. <em>DON'T FORGET THE
	SWINGARM RUBBER BOOT!</em>

<h2>Carbs / Fuel</h2>

<h3><font color="red">Balancing</font></h3>

	... is a bit of a bastard, but if the carbs are out of balance it'll
	run like a pig. Details are here: 
	<A HREF="carb_tune.html">Carb Tuning for XLV750R</a>

<h3><font color="red">Needles and Springs</font></h3>

	<em>Thanks to Ruschie and Steve Curtis:</em>
	On the Aussie model, the front and back carbs aren't the same.

	<table border=1 bgcolor="#000055">

			<th bgcolor="#550000">FRONT
			<th bgcolor="#550000">BACK
		<tr><td>Needle:<td>1CE<td>3MN
		<tr><td>Spring:<td>16 turn<br>180 mm<td>15 turn<br>165 mm
	</table>
	<p>

<h3><font color="red">Sliders / Diaphragms</font></h3>

	The carb slides can get sticky and reluctant to move:
	this causes sluggish acceleration and much snap-crackle-and-pop
	on decelleration.  Sometimes you can free them up by
	removing the airbox lid, spraying a little carb cleaner
	down and pushing them up by hand.  They should fall back
	into place smoothly and rapidly.

<h3><font color="red">Jets</font></h3>

	Stock is #118 main and #42 slow. Mine seems better with #122
	main and #40 slow, but then my <A HREF="../efi/zorst.html">pipe</A>
	isn't exactly stock.  The needles wear pretty
	bad, richening up the midrange and causing a lot of spluttering
	and backfire, going to #40 slow jets has helped this and
	fuel range is much improved.
	<p>
	<em>Anyone with input on their favourite jetting, that'd be great.</em>
	<p>
	<em>(Or you could <A HREF="../efi/">Play with EFI</A>)</em>

<h3><font color="red">Fuel Pump</font></h3>

	<ul>

	<li>Note that fuel will still flow from a full tank to the
	carbs with the fuel pump not running -- it just won't
	flow when the fuel level gets low.  And since the CDIs
	are powered from the CDI coils, if you lose 12V, you
	can still struggle home so long as you keep the tank
	topped up.
	
	<li>The fuel pump
	relay seems like a total waste of time, serving only
	to make the bike harder to start on reassembly. I ran
	my XLV for months with a diode inserted in the connector
	as per the 'testing the fuel pump' section of the manual
	with no problems. I'm not sure that the diode was 
	necessary, but it's easy to insert in the connector ...
	
	<li><em>Conceivably,
	if the bike falls over with the ignition on, the lack
	of a relay could cause the tank contents to be pumped
	out through the float bowls, but this never proved
	to be a problem :-)</em>

	<li>Since the pump only delivers 3-5 psi, if it fails
	it might be easier to ditch it and replace with a vacuum-operated
	pump. see

<A NAME="Heads"></A>
<h2>Heads and Head Covers</h2>

<h3><font color="red">Rocker Eccentrics</font></h3>

	The rocker arms pivot on an eccentric pivot, which is 
	adjusted by the hydraulic lifter. The eccentric is 
	usually biased towards the inside of the motor. If 
	the eccentrics aren't held in place properly as
	the head cover is attached, they can end up locked
	at full extension, causing the valves to be propped
	open by ~2mm at all times.<p>

	It's pretty obvious when it happens ... the head 
	cover won't sit flat on the head even at TDC, because
	the valve springs are being compressed.<p>

	<em>You'd have to be an incompetent prick of a professional
	mechanic to miss this one, eh?</em><p>

	For some reason, this seems to happen more easily
	to the exhaust rockers. A gentle push with a 
	screwdriver between the valve-stem end of the
	rocker and the head cover will realign the eccentrics
	to face inwards.<p>

<h3><font color="red">Rocker Covers</font></h3>

	I don't know if this has been a problem for anyone else,
	but both of my original tappet covers developed hairline
	cracks which wept oil ... if the engine is always oily
	it's worth a look.

<h3><font color="red">Valve Springs</font></h3>

	The exhaust valve outer springs are painted green, but on older
	bikes this paint can be hard to spot. They are also around
	2mm shorter and have one less turn from end to end.<p>
	The inner springs appear to all be identical.<p>

<A NAME="Hydros"></A>
<h3><font color="red">Hydralic Tappets</font></h3>

	<em>Thanks to Rossco:</em> If bad oil has been used the
	hydraulic tappets may get sticky and make a
	ticking sound, and the cam chain tensioners too may stick.
	Both of these are hard to fix as the rear tappet cover cannot
	be removed with the engine in place.<p>

<A NAME="CamChain"></A>
<h3><font color="red">Sticky Cam Chain Tensioner Wedges</font></h3>

	<em><A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ozhondav-twinadventurers/message/418?threaded=1">Thanks to Warren</A>:</em>
	The cam chain tensioner wedges sticking seems to be an 
	ongoing problem for some bikes, and can't be readily fixed
	with the engine in.
	
	<table><tr><td>
	<A HREF="pix/xlv-camchain-bolt.jpg">
	<img border=1 src="pix/xlv-camchain-bolt-thumb.jpg"></A>
	</td><td>While it's out, there's a possible
	modification - drill a hole in the covers above each 
	tensioner, tap it and plug with a screw. If the tensioners
	stick again, remove the screw and use a tool to press the
	wedges down. <b>I'm trying this modification myself
	at the moment ... yep, and it seems to work quite well.
	The rear cylinder bolt is awful close to the frame rail
	though, so access there is tricky. But it seems to be
	my front cylinder one that sticks anyway.</b>
	</td></tr></table>

<h3><font color="red">Oil Y-line bolts</font></h3>

	Make sure these are the original ones, with a thin shaft 
	before the thread.  A 'normal' bolt will restrict oil-flow
	to the heads.

<hr>

<A NAME="Pistons"></A>
<h2>Cylinder Barrels and Pistons</h2>

<h3><font color="red">Spark Plug Tubes</font></h3>

	To remove the Spark Plug Tubes, find a bolt with a 27mm head.
	Steering head bolts are often this size on smaller, older bikes
	(Kawasaki Z250B, for instance). You should be able to find
	something like this at a wreckers yard.<p>

	You can grind flats onto the threaded part either two for
	an open spanner or six for a ring spanner / socket. It's
	not as tricky as it sounds because if you hold the 27mm 
	head in a vice, you can turn it one face at a time and
	thus get the alignment of the sides right. Well, right 
	enough anyway. I ground mine down to 13mm, there's a 
	little thread showing on the corners still but it works 
	fine. If I get overenthusiastic I might finish it off
	to a proper 12mm on the mill, or just pound a cheapo
	13mm 3/8" socket on the end ...<p>

	Remember, you don't need much torque to install this part.<p>

	Don't forget to vacuum and/or blow out with compressed
	air to clean all the grit out of the tubes ... otherwise
	it'll fall into the cylinder and/or cam chain journal.<p>

<A NAME="Guts"></A>
<h2>Engine Guts</h2>

<h3><font color="red">Clutch center nut</font></h3>

	<em>Thanks to Rossco:</em> You also need to check the nut that
	holds the clutch basket on the shaft, clean and locktite the
	threads. Been known to come loose and destroy the
	engine, loses drive to the oil pump.<p>

	<blockquote>
	<em>Steve Jordan writes:</em> 
	Clutch cable got a bit of slack in it and I thought it was the
	cable seizing up. Got worse within about a hundred klicks [...]
	Completely stopped disengaging [...] kept  going as no apparent
	other problems.  Stopped to rendezvous [...]
	Roll started and when I put it into third the oil light came on.
	Went out when I backed off and went on when revved and back off
	when idling, then on and stayed on. Stopped the bike and trailed
	it back home.  Just pulled it apart and found the centre nut was loose.
	</blockquote>

	<em>My reply:</em> Make sure [the clutch] engages properly and
	the oil pump drive gear pins and the
	clutch basket holes are still square and not battered to pieces by
	each other.  You'll be able to feel the pins engage the holes.  I've
	never had a problem when that center nut is torqued correctly, but
	you could loctite it if you're worried.  It needs a _lot_ of torque ...

<h3><font color="red">Removing the Generator</font></h3>

<b>Do not prise coils!</b>

<ol>
<li>Remove the three screws holding the generator in and the screw 
holding the cable clamp.  Replace the cross-head ones with hex head ones,
you'll thank yourself for it some day.
<li>Remove the two little cross-head screws holding the earth ends of the 
exciter coils.  Leave the lugs where they are.
<li>Put something in the center of the coils to lever against.
<li>Thread a 1" or so long M5 screw into each earth screw holes
and lever very gently with a crowbar (one after the other)
</ol>

<A NAME="Exciter"></A>
<h3><font color="red">CDI Exciter coils</font></h3>

	See
	<A HREF="http://moto.zoic.org/xlv/manual/">The Manual</a>
	especially Chapter 17: Ignition and the Chapter 20: Wiring Diagram.
	<p>
	<em>Thanks to Rossco:</em> The exciter coils that charge the
	cdi's can break down, any bike with more than 30,000 probably
	has had it done by now. Its an easy to get to part, under the
	left engine side cover.
	<p>
	These coils are part of the generator, which is under the LHS engine
	cover.  The wiring runs up to under the RHS side cover, and then to the
	CDI units.  There are two coils, each of which should be between 250
	and 350 ohms to chassis.  With the engine running, there should be a
	large AC voltage on each, 100VAC-250VAC.  Be careful.  If they burn
	out, one or both cylinders run poorly or stop working entirely.
	<p>
	<em>Thanks to BT Humble:</em>
	You can bodge around the
	exciter coils by using a mains transformer backwards. 
	see the <A HREF="news:aus.motorcycles">aus.moto</A> thread <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=bea156c2.0111281348.3befe8c7%40posting.google.com">"Whale Oil Beef Hooked"</A> if you dare!<p>

	<blockquote><pre>
From: B. T. Humble

	Four days without a ride was just getting intolerable, so I had
another look at the CDI/Stator problem on The Terrible Vee (CX500).
It has high-voltage windings inside the alternator to supply ~100VAC
to the CDI, and these must have been designed specifically for the
Australian market by a Japanese bloke who was still peeved about
losing the war...

After a bit of head scratching I retrieved a 240V-&gt;12V transformer
from my junk box, and piggybacked the 12V winding onto one of the
15VAC charging circuit windings.  I then hooked up the 240V winding to
the high-voltage input of the CDI, and lit the blue touch paper...

Amazingly, it works.  At idle (1500rpm) it produces 140VAC which makes
for really good starting, however since this transformer was designed
for use at 50Hz the secondary voltage drops off rapidly as RPM
increases (about 60VAC at 4000RPM), ultimately limiting the engine to
around 5500RPM while under load (I think this is due to the inductance
of the windings?).

Since the secondary transformer winding is rated at 800mA and I was
able to ride the bike for about 30km without burning it out (it only
got slightly warm), I'd guess it's drawing less than an amp from the
alternator, which is the equivalent of adding a 12W light to the
electrical load.  (I don't have an AC ammeter so I don't know for
sure).

Looks like a simple inverter will do the job after all, and a lot
cheaper than $200 for a secondhand stator or about the same for a
rewind.  Also I'm not enthusiastic about dropping the motor _again_ to
replace the stator, so this'll keep me going for a while. :-)

	<blockquote><pre>
From: sharkey

So I tried it. Hulking great transformer from an old power
supply, 30VAC windings across the stator, 240VAC windings
into the CDI boxes. And the bloody thing worked!

Mr B T Humble, should you ever visit Melbourne (eg: the Supers!)
I'll buy you at least a large beer or three.

I ran it long enough to get me home then changed the
stator. The transformer weighed about a kilo and got ... quite warm ...
in any case!
		</pre></blockquote>

	Mine lasted over 60,000 kms before they finally failed, both
	at once strangely enough. Oddly enough, when I replaced
	the coils fuel efficiency went up 25%, suggesting that
	a hot spark is essential, or something like that anyway.<p>

	Small Coil Rewinds in Geelong has been rewinding these sorts
	of coils approximately forever, and have done coils for several
	list members.  They'll only do the whole stator, not just the
	CDI exciter coils though.<p>

	<em>Steven J. Curtis writes:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<tt>Andy Wheeler in Gosford [...]
	winds with heavier wire so that they don't burn out but you have
	less turns and therefore I got the fuel economy problem.
	He says the honda spec is 3500 turns of X gauge, he winds 3200
	turns of the next heaver wire. That was enough on mine to drop
	the fuel consumption about 3 - 4 k per litre.</tt>"<p>

	<em>Ross Lawrence writes:</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;"<tt>[I recommend]
	Dave Turner [from Queensland] Ph 07 3402 4429.  He works from home
	and does lots of the bike shop work in Brisbane, along with a
	fair bit of work sent from interstate.
	Dave also states that the insulation on the winding wire has been upgraded in recent times, apparently the old stuff was only rated to 140 degrees C but the new stuff is good for 200 degrees C. This may help to explain why they failed every so often, on the air cooled motors especially.</tt>"<p>

	Rossco, Steve and I are all thinking of ways to eliminate the
	damned things.  Presumably a <A HREF="../efi/ignite.html">DC-DC converter</A>
	could do the job ... I think they're only drawing
	about 15W each ...<p>

	I did end up trying out an inverter solution, you can read about it at

<A NAME="Oil"></A>
<h2>Oil and Oil Cooler</h2>

<h3><font color="red">Oil Cooler Lines</font></h3>

	Be careful removing the lower oil cooler line from the oil
	cooler. The connector gets quite seized and it is possible
	to tear the end off the oil cooler by applying too much 
	torque. You can undo the other end of the line (where it
	attaches to the engine) far more easily.<p>

	I made the mistake, and ruined my oil cooler. I bought
	a replacement from a wreckers ... exactly the same thing
	had happened to it and they'd welded it up.<p>

	If you do need to remove this line, lock a spanner into
	a vice and use it to hold the octagonal extension out of
	the bottom of the oil cooler. You can now put torque on
	the connector without damaging the cooler itself.<p>

	Remember, a little WD40 / RP7 / etc goes a long way when
	dealing with seized threads.<p>

<A NAME="Wheels"></A>
<h2>Wheels / Suspension / Final Drive</h2>

<h3><font color="red">Front Brake</font></h3>

 The front caliper slides on a pair of pins, the pins
 are meant to be covered in grease, the grease is retained by three
 little rubber boots.  The rubber boots fail every 20-30000km,
 and the grease gets out, the water gets in, the pins seize and the
 brakes turn to shit.  To fix, disassemble, degrease, remove rust from
 pins, replace rubber boots w/ new, grease, reassemble.  It's no
 sports bike, but adequate for a 90/90-21 ...

<h3><font color="red">Rear Brake</font></h3>

Back brake is rubbish, can be made less worse by fitting new shoes
(perhaps slot them with a hacksaw) and adjusting the pull rod setup
carefully for maximum leverage.

<h3><font color="red">Forks</font></h3>

	<A HREF="http://www.proven.com.au/">Proven Suspension</A>
	sell replacement progressive forksprings for the XLV.
	<p>
	The fork seals are tricky to get back in because the bores they live
	in are quite deep ... I use a 40x32 PVC pipe
	joiner, with the ID turned to 44mm and the smaller OD=52mm.  If you
	don't have a lathe handy you could always just file it out, not much
	needs to be removed.  This slips down over the fork leg with 
	the smaller end bearing on the seal, and then I whack it in with a bit 
	of steel pipe slipped over the fork leg.

<h3><font color="red">Rear Shockie</font></h3>

<table><td>
	<A HREF="pix/xlv-bitubo-ize.jpg"><img border=1 src="pix/xlv-bitubo-ize-133.jpg"></A>
</td><td>
	Your options:
	<ul>
	<li> Get the shock rebuild.  It's officially unrebuildable,
	but there are folks out there doing it anyway!  Rossco
	recommended RAD Shockies in Brisbane.
        <li> <a href="http://www.advrider.com/forums/showthread.php?t=381537">Rebuild it yourself.</a>
	<li> Bitubo make replacement shockies for the XLV.  I just
	fitted a shiny IZE (adjustable preload and rebound damping)
	to mine (see photo at left).
	<li> Bounce around like a mad thing on a shock made
	of soggy cardboard ...
	</ul>
</td></table>

<h3><font color="red">Rear Wheel Bearing</font></h3>

	The larger of the two rear wheel bearings seems to wear
	out its seat (I've seen this on two XLVs, 65k and 72k,
	and heard about it from many listmembers),
	and too much play at this bearing can seriously wear
	the spline drives. Check it every now and then.<p>

	<ol>	<li>Remove rear wheel
		<li>Remove final driven flange
		<li>Insert axle through bearings
		<li>Wiggle axle and look for bearing free play.
	</ol><p>

	The problem is, once the bearing can move a little
	it wear the seat a little more ... if left, the problem
	increases.  And then the weight of the bike is supported
	by the final drive bearings, via the splines.  Not good
	for the splines, which are meant to only take rotational
	loads, not axial ones.<p>

	If it's real bad, the rear wheel needs to be machined and
	a sleeve inserted to fix this problem. This fix seems to have
	worked well on my XLV -- at least 30,000km have passed.<p>

		I thought you might find a use for some pictures of my
		'saved' rear wheel bearing to go with previous 'common
		failure' notes you have published before.
		<p>
		The inboard bearing had worn loose and enlarged the hole.
		It was only after the replacement set of bearings failed that I
		had it checked out properly, and found that the bearings were
		almost a millimetre too close for the spacer (nipping the
		bearing).  Whether this had resulted from the spacer fretting
		between bearings or the outer race wearing the alloy hub, I
		don't know.
		<p>
		The machinist sleeved the inboard bearing and re-worked the
		shoulders to match the new spacer tube from Honda. The repair
		looks pretty good, and it has saved the bike!

	<p>

	<em>NOTE: When removing or reinserting bearings, heat the
	hub to approx 100 &#176;C (eg: so water sizzles gently on the
	hub). This prevents damage to the aluminium seat and
	causes the bearing to 'lock' into place.</em><p>

	Less worn out bearing seats may be fixable with
	<A HREF="http://www.loctite.co.uk/PRODUCTS/641.htm">Loctite 641</A>
	...  normal Loctite nutlocker <em>doesn't work</em>, but 641 is
	designed for the purpose and seems to have worked on my
	other rear wheel bearing -- the RHS bearing started to
	spin a few thousand ago. On advice from a local garage,
	I staked the bearing seat with three circuits of punch marks with
	a centerpunch, raising many little craters in the aluminium 
	seat.  Then I liberally coated the area with loctite 641
	and installed the bearing.  It seems to work -- the loctite
	retains the bearing, and the punch marks retain the loctite.<p>

<h3><font color="red">Spline Drive</font></h3>

	The spline drive in a shaft-drive bike is quite vulnerable
	to damage if not looked after ... even more so on an
	off-road bike where dirt and hard knocks are common.<p>

	To protect the splines, they should be packed with
	MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> (Molybdenum Disulphide) grease.
	Get a thick layer of grease all over them, don't be afraid to
	make a mess! <em>Make sure you don't get grease in the
	brake drum though ...</em><p> 

	This grease is retained by 2 O-rings ... one on the base
	of the Final Driven Flange (attached to the wheel) and the
	other on an 'O-ring carrier' inside the ring gear splines.
	Make sure these O-rings are present and in good condition.<p>

	There are also spline connections at either end of the
	shaft and the uni joint ... if you remove the final drive,
	repack these with grease as well, and make sure the rubber
	seal at the back of the engine is in place correctly.<p>

	<em>Photos to come ...</em><p>

<h3><font color="red">Swingarm Bearings</font></h3>

	These wear out easily, especially the right hand one
	for some reason. You can undo the locknut with a pin
	punch, but getting the pivots out will require a 17mm
	Allen Key :-(.<p>
I ended up drilling, tapping and installing grease nipples in the pivot pins.  Then discovered how easily the seals back out, so the seals now have tiny grease outlet holes drilled in them.  On the up-side, I can now grease my SA bearings every ride, on the down-side, now I have to do so!
	<p>
	<em>Thanks to Rojaws:</em>
	<blockquote>
I reckon the right hand swing arm bearing wears because the seal on the
pivot pin is prone to working loose and exposing the bearing to road dirt.
I put a garden tie around the neck of the pin and so far no more trouble.
