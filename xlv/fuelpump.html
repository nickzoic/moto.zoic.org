pump update<br>
for the Africa twin</font></b></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><img height="243" width="378" hspace="20" align="right" border="0" alt="Fuel Pump AT" src="pix/newpump1.jpg">On some models of the Africa twin (type RD07) the
gasoline pump fails occasionally. Usually the electrical contacts inside the control unit
of the pump are charred. It can be repaired by cleaning the contacts, however success is
only of short duration. Sometimes the damage is caused by a missing ventilation hose, so
that humidity can penetrate the contacts. If there is a hose, it is probably clogged, so
that the humidity cannot get out. But sometimes everything is correct with the
ventilation, but the pump fails nevertheless, as it happened to my buddy Stefan, whose
Twin stopped already four times for that reason.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He had already installed a new (expensive!) pump, but
it failed again after a couple of months. So I suggested to install a vacuum-driven pump
of a Yamaha, e. g. XTZ 660, XTZ 750 or TDM 850, which I
am using since a long time for the bigger tank of my Transalp. You can get this pump at a
wrecker's for approx. DEM 40. - to DEM 80. -, a new (Yamaha) pump is for approx. DEM 160.

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition, you can purchase this kind of pump also
from a KTM dealer, a new one is for about DEM 120. -</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you prefer genuine Honda parts, also the
electrically driven pump of a CBR 600 F can be used. Except for the cap and a somewhat
shorter power cable it is identical to the Africa Twin pump.</font></p>

<p><u><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Changing the pump</b></font></u></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><img height="245" width="310" align="right" hspace="20" border="0" alt="Fuel Pump AT" src="pix/oldpump2.jpg">To change the pump, the fuel tank and the seat must be
removed. Then remove the original gasoline pump. Remove the plug for the synchronous
tester at the rear intake and put in the adapter for the vacuum hose.The thread has to be
coated with Locktite before in order to seal it and to prevent a rotation of the adapter.
Clamp the aluminum sheet in a parallel vice, bend it and form the shape with a file, so
that the new fuel pump can be fixed at the crankshaft housing. Connect the 18 cm hose to
the vacuum link of the pump and to the adapter at the intake and fix it with the hose
clips. Then connect the carburetor's original fuel hose to the pressure plug of the pump.
Install the fuel tank and connect the 43 cm hose to the suction plug of the pump and the
fuel cock. Now, the seat can be attached. Make shure, that the pump and the hoses 
don't scrub at the frame or somewhere else. Open the fuel cock and start the
engine.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><img height="243" width="378" align="right" hspace="20" border="0" alt="Vacuum Pump" src="pix/newpump1.jpg">According to Stefan his twin starts better than before
with the modified gasoline pump. Additionally the weigth of his bike is now reduced by 270
g, which is noticeable in view to its 53 litre seizing fuel tank :-)).</font></p>
