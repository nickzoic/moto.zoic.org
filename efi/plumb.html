<A NAME="parts">
<h2>GPz Parts</h2>

Grabbing the whole GPz1100 kit and kaboodle means that I've got
the whole pile of motorcycle-friendly parts.  In particular,
the fuel pump and fuel regulator are external units rather than
built into the tank.

<h2>Low Pressure Fuel</h2>

<ul>
<li> There's a stock outlet stub from the tap, is that going to
	be big enough?
<li> It'll need a fuel return stub back into the tank, and
	some way to stop that draining / siphoning.
<li> Alternately, a small header tank with cooling fins could
	fill this role instead, topped up from the real tank.
<li>I'd like to provide some way to access a tail tank while
	on the move.  If the EFI pump is pulling from the tail
	tank and returning to the main tank, that should 
	take care of moving the weight forward.  This might
	involve some taps and non-return valves.  10L would
	be plenty.
</ul>

<A NAME="high">
<h2>High Pressure Fuel</h2>

While most vehicle fuel systems use solid fuel rails, etc, this isn't
really convenient for a V-twin.  The injectors are solidly held into
the throttle bodies already, thankfully. All the fuel plumbing is going to
have to use high-pressure EFI fuel line and clamps, but what the
hell, there's only two injectors.  Hopefully I can get all the
bits in the right sizes (the pump outlet is particularly large).
If the bit of line connecting the jets could be bigger than the
injector stubs, that'd be good too, just like the stock GPz fuel
rail.

<A NAME="vac">
<h2>Manifold Air Pressure</h2>

The fuel pressure regulator uses MAP as a reference pressure.  
The ECU may need a pressure input too.  There's a vacuum 
reference stub on the top of each throttle body, these can
be connected with vacuum hose and T-pieces.  An inline fuel
filter could be used to provide some extra volume for 
damping out pressure fluctuations.
