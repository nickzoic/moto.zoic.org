<h1>Homebrew EFI -- the ECU</h1>

<h2>Existing ECUs</h2>

	<strong>Update 2008:  The <a href="http://www.microsquirt.info/">MicroSquirt</a> looks like it fulfills all my requirements.  This page is only here for hysterical porpoises.</strong>
        <p>
	The simplest way to build the ECU would be to use an
	existing design such as the Bowling &amp; Grippo 
	<A HREF="http://www.bgsoflex.com/megasquirt.html">MegaSquirt</A>
	or the <A HREF="http://caffrey.dk/megasquirt/">MegaSquirtAVR</A>.
	On the other hand, part of the fun of this project is
	to hack together something out of nothing, so I'm 
	considering designing my own ECU.

<h2>Designing New Hardware</h2>

<h3>Injector Drivers</h3>

	The <A HREF="throttle.html#Injectors">injectors</A> I'm
	using are low impedance types, which need some kind
	of current control device.  I can't help thinking that
	the simplest way to drive them is going to be to use a 
	<A HREF="http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM1949.html">LM1949 Injector 
	Drive Controller</A> which is designed for this very task
	and available in an 8-pin DIP package.

<h3>Ignition</h3>

	Eventually, I'd like to get rid of the standard
	'black box' CDI units and bring ignition advance
	under software control.  Before I do this, I'll
	have to learn a bit more about CDIs.  Due to the
	high voltages involved, I'll build the 
	<A HREF="ignite.html">igniter units</A>
	into a separate box, driven from optoisolated
	outputs from the ECU.

<h3>Idiot Lights</h3>

	One or more idiot lights on the dashboard can reveal
	operating mode and any error conditions.  If the
	microcontroller can source 20mA, LEDs won't even
	need drivers?

<h3>Other Outputs</h3>

	The engine has to switch the fuel pump and the 
	O2 sensor heater on and off.   I'd like it to
	take control of the starter motor too, I think,
	locking it out once the motor is running.
	Either darlington drivers or MOSFETS would be
	useful for this.  

<h2>Designing New Software</h2>

<h2>Older Thoughts:</h2>

	This stuff is based on my original notes, and will
	slowly be replaced by the newer, more organized stuff
	above.

<h3>General:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The environment on a motorbike is even tougher than
	that in a car engine bay, with cold rain, hot oil and
	warm beer frequently sloshing around.  Also, the electronics
	must be protected from impact and vibration, especially
	on an off-roader.  Locking the circuit inside a sealed,
	die-cast aluminium box seems to be the way to go here.
	Cable entry would need to be via waterproof cable glands.
	The Alumnimium box would also provide an effective heat-sink.
	(as long as it wasn't mounted too close to the exhaust pipe).
	Foam inserts (rather than solid screw mounts) could protect
	the board from vibration, although having a bunch of TO-220
	components bolted to the case might stop this working. 
	Maybe bending their legs into an S shape would be sufficient.

	<li>Size is at a premium too.  On a car-oriented design,
	you've got a lot of spare volume under the hood.  For
	a bike, you're much more restricted: 6" x 4" x 2" would
	be about the limit on the XLV.  The MegaSquirt is 
	6.25" x 4.25" x 1.75" so that's at least the right ballpark.
	Jaycar sell nice sealed boxes 115 x 90 x 55
	(4" x 3.5" x 2.1") which might be a goer if it can all
	be made to fit.

	<li>The CPU should do as much as possible, thus minimizing
	interface components.  It's easier to fit more code in
	the box than more parts.  However, a one-chip solution is
	far preferable to a two-chip solution, because tracks
	eat up board space.  This indicates a CPU with onboard
	RAM, ROM, ADCs and PWM.  Fortunately, modern microcontrollers
	come with an amazing amount of that kind of thing.
</ul>
<h3>Outputs:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Use MOSFETs and SCRs where appropriate to minimize
	heat dissipation.  TO220 and TO126 devices fit more easily
	than TO3!

	<li>It should also control the ignition (CDI) timing and
	(solid state) fuel pump relay, and maybe even an electronic
	cooling fan for bikes which have one.  If a flyback is
	needed to produce the CDI voltages, the CPU can control that
	as well. A bypass valve may be needed to raise cold idle.
	K-bikes apparently send the starter motor signal via the
	ECU to stop it spinning when the engine is turning, which
	is a thought.  

	<li>Also has to switch on O2 sensor heaters. Should be
	in the order of <A HREF="http://www.splitsec.com/products/ego1/ego1ds.htm">2A each</A>

	<li>Communication to the user should be via a single
	'idiot' light LED on the dash.  Green for go, Orange for
	trouble, Red for failure.  Flashing patterns can indicate 
	what the problem is.  More idiot lights on the board can
	help with side-of-the-road diagnosis too.  And now Jaycar
	sell RGB LEDs!  More lights, more lights!

</ul>
<h3>Inputs:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Should use existing crank sensors where possible.
	Generator phase may provide extra information here if
	needed ... check frequency per RPM (bike generators
	are often mounted on the end of the crank).  On the
	other hand, the current CDI system uses these sensors,
	and apparently CDI phase is more critical than EFI
	phase anyway.

	<li>Lambda / O2 / EGO sensor(s) -- apparently vary
	between 0 and 1 volt, impedance in the order of 
	1 Mohm.  So it'll need some kind of shielding
	(or at least noise rejection) and
	Hi-Z buffering.  It'd want to be a heated one,
	so that's 4-wire.
	
	<li>Manifold vacuum, TPS, CHT -- use
	commercially available sensors and interfaces to avoid
	disappointment.

	<li>Killswitch should immediately stop ignition,
	fuel pump, everything stone dead.  It should not
	just signal the controller, it should operate an
	override relay or something in case of disaster.

	<li>Starter button feeds into the ECU so that it
	can refuse to run the starter w/ the engine going.
	Maybe the button could be used to communicate with the ECU
	when the engine _is_ running? Eg: to change maps.

	<li>Power/Economy switch?  Wheel speed?  Accelerometer?
	Speedshifter? <A HREF="http://www.ibutton.com">iButton</A>
	for an ignition lock?  The possibilities are endless :-)
</ul>
