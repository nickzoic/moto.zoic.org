<h1>Homebrew EFI -- Ignition!</h1>

The XLVs ignition system is <A HREF="/xlv/tech_tips.html#Exciter">
dodgy at best</A>, so it seems like a good idea to replace it.
<p>
The question being: how to make an ECU controlled CDI system?
<p>
I'm getting a lot of inspiration from this article:
<A HREF="http://www.not2fast.com/ignition/cap-dis-ignit-cdi.pdf">
A high-energy capacitor discharge ignition system</A>
<A HREF="http://www.molla.org/DIY-CDI/SC-DIY-CDI-article-hires.pdf">[alt]</a>
by John Clarke (<A HREF="http://www.siliconchip.com.au/">Silicon Chip</A>
September 1997).  There's now a <A HREF="http://www.dse.com.au/">Dick Smith</A> kit for this, I think!  K3307.
<p>
Here's a page on <A HREF="http://www.transalp.de/technik/pd-technik/reparaturen/zuendbox.php">Transalp CDIs</A>, including a <A HREF="pix/schematic.jpg">schematic</A>.  The Transalp ones
include their own high-voltage generators.  And some notes on
a <A HREF="http://www.sportdevices.com/ignition/ignition.htm">PIC-based programmable CDI</A>

<h2>High Voltage Supply</h2>

The first step is to generate ~300VDC which is used to charge
the capacitors in the CDI units.  The SC article uses a regulated
stepup power supply from 9-15VDC, running at 20kHz.
<p>
This could also be used to power the XLV's stock CDIs, and this
is probably where I'll start.

<h2>Microcontroller Interface</h2>

Some parts of the circuit become unnecessary due to the
microcontroller's interface ... and the CDI section of the 
circuit will have to be doubled up for the XLVs two sets
of coils.  Maybe even quadrupled up to give the coils one
driver each.  *sigh*.

<h2>News</h2>

I've put it together, and already smoked out the veroboard!
Oh dear ...
<br>
<A HREF="pix/img_1170-800.jpg"><IMG border=1 SRC="pix/img_1170-133.jpg"></A> 
<A HREF="pix/img_1168-800.jpg"><IMG border=1 SRC="pix/img_1168-133.jpg"></A>
<br>
... I was worried that it was a fundamental design flaw, but it
turns out there are limits on how much current the poor
veroboard tracks will stand, and running at 100% duty cycle exceeds those
limits!  Why 100% duty cycle?  Well, it turns out that the
XLV CDIs use an SCR to short the capacitor, and these don't
'turn off' until no current flows ... whereas this circuit never
stops!  It also turns out that the 'kill switch' stops the engine
by shorting the output of the CDIs to ground.  Suboptimal.
<p>
So, I'm putting together a new version of the circuit to 
get around this, and rerouting the 'kill switch' lead to 
turn the inverter off rather than shorting it out.  Additionally,
the 1uF output capacitor will get a lot smaller and the
regulator circuit will change to compensate for that, and 
a 555 circuit will be used to switch the inverter on and off
with a duty cycle of ~95% at ~1kHz, imitating the voltage 
characteristics of the coil generator.  An extra diode or two
need to be added as well ...
<p>
Well, that didn't work at all.  I could make it run by dropping
the switching frequency to a couple of hundred hertz, but the
voltage output was disappointing.  I also tried gating the
voltage on and off with a pair of transistors, but that did
the same thing ... locked up and strangled itself, and another
MTP3055V hit the bin.
<p>
As a really dumb test, I tried
<A HREF="/xlv/tech_tips.html#Exciter">wiring a
mains transformer backwards</A> to feed the CDIs, but with
a couple of rectifiers to knock out the negative-going sides ...
which idled very nicely, but wouldn't rev above 3000rpm.
I've got this horrible feeling that some part of the advance
circuit depends on the generator input frequency: either
that or the transformer just isn't producing enough something.

<h2>Sod it!</h2>

I've given up for the moment, and bought a new set of stator
coils ... at least that way I can put the 'scope on them
for volts and amps and see what they're really doing ...
and my work on the AVR CDI controller continues ... since
it'll be a bit smarter than the stock CDI units, it'll
put less load on the coils, and maybe they won't burn
out again.  Here's hoping.
