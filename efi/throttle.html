<h1>Homebrew EFI -- the throttle bodies</h1>

The throttle bodies I'm using are two of the four used on a Kawasaki GPz1100B2,
I think this is the Aussie name for what is elsewhere called the Z1100B2,
and I think it's the same system as on the ZX1100A as well.  It's a bank
of four 34mm throttle bodies, each with a single butterfly and injector.

<A NAME="Fitting">
<h2>Fitting to the XLV</h2>

<a href="pix/engine.jpg"><img border=1 width=133 height=100 src="pix/engine-thumb.jpg"></A>
<p>
The XLV is a narrow-angle (45&deg;) V-twin, normally fitted with 
<A HREF="carbs.html">a pair of downdraught CV carbs</A> between
the cylinders.  The frame
above the engine forms the airbox, with the airfilter installed
in it.  Thankfully, the carbs are quite bulky, so there's plenty
of room for the throttle bodies despite my clumsy engineering!
The headroom is a bit restricted though -- it's not going to
be easy.

The carbs are 33mm venturi, but their outlet stubs are 42mm OD.
In contrast, the <A HREF="pdf/tbody.pdf">GPz1100 throttle bodies [PDF]</A>
are 34mm throughout, with an
OD of 40mm.  This means, sadly, that they won't squash neatly
into the XLV carb mounting rubbers after all :-(.
<p>
To get around this I plan to machine up aluminium 'adaptor rings', which
will match the ID and OD of the original carbs at one end and
push/glue onto the throttle bodies at the other.
<A HREF="pdf/inletring3.pdf">Here's an approximation [PDF]</A>
Similar ones will be needed at the top of the TBs to to match the
rubber horns from the airbox.
<p>
<!--For the short term, air feed into the bodies will be via the stock
rubber horns and bits of 40mm ID pool drain hose ... not
exactly sophisticated but it should keep the grit out 
of the prototype!  Eventually, metal adaptors will be used
for this too.-->
<p>
Being a narrow V, nothing lines up with anything else, including
the carbs.  The cylinders are at 45&deg; to each other, but the
inlet ports are angled 37.5&deg; from the plane of the head.
A bit of judicious protractoring suggests that the
TBs will be at 30&deg; to each other, and their common shaft
will be 73mm above the port surface (their outlet is 43mm 
below the shaft, so that's 30mm to be made up with the mounting
rubbers and the adaptor rings).  They're offset 80mm 
sideways between centers, slightly further apart than the
stock GPZ ones.  <em>I should draw up a diagram of this too!</em>
<p>
<b>GPz TBs:</b>

<p>
<b>Inlet Rings:</b>

<p>
The usual row-of-carbs-joined-by-linkages needs a
twist in the middle, so the first step is to make a couple of
brackets to hold the two TBs properly aligned and separated.
I made up some prototype brackets
out of steel to test this idea, and they seem to fit 
together okay.  I'll have to make up a little piece to 
connect the two shafts though. 
<p>
The prototypes are drilled slightly oversize and bent by hand, so
they're not terribly accurate -- the bodies end up incorrectly 
aligned.  I'll have to be much more accurate for the final version.
<p>
<b>Brackets:</b>

<p>
It looks like I'll be able to use the 'pull cable' setup
from the GPZ more-or-less unmodified, although I may have
to reverse it since the carb is now laying down.
<p>
The GPZ idle setup doesn't really translate to the V-twin.
Instead, a small block of aluminium bolted to the base of the
supports an idle speed setting screw with a knurled knob.
I'm not sure how to handle fast-idle yet ... perhaps a 
solenoid-controlled 'leak' into the MAP sensor ports?

<A NAME="TPS">
<h2>Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)</h2>

<a href="pix/tps.jpg"><img border=1 width=133 height=100 src="pix/tps-thumb.jpg"></A>

<a href="pix/tps_conn.jpg"><img border=1 width=133 height=100 src="pix/tps_conn-thumb.jpg"></A>
<p>

The TPS is just a sealed 5Kohm variable resistor, mounted on the end of one
of the throttle shafts.  It's wired back to the ECU (via screened cable?)
It seems to fit easily enough, and I like the cheesy "DFI" logo on the
cover!  If it turns out to be shot I'll buy a Farnell part instead,
but keep the DFI cover :-)

<h2>Injectors</h2>

<p>
<em>Yeah, I know some of the photos are crap (the yellowish ones,
generally).  I'm only just working out how this camera thinks,
I'll put new ones up as I go ...</em>
<p>

The injectors came with the bodies, they have "JECS", "E" (or maybe "F"),
"MADE IN JAPAN" and "A46-00" moulded into their tails and "C146" and
"3516A" stamped into the top.  They're a <A HREF="http://www.sdsefi.com/injectors.htm">low-impedance, pintle-type injector</A>.
<p>
Apparently they're a 180cc/min, used by the Nissan 200SX/LZ20B motor and 
the Nissan 280ZX/L28 motor, and need 2A peak and 500mA hold (thanks Tony).
<p>
<em><small>From Arttu:<blockquote>
	These values seems to be correct, according my tests.
	<p>
	I measured flow rate and it was about 190-200cc/min. Fuel pressure was
	roughly 2.7bar with GPZ1100 regulator.
	<p>
	In my installation maximum injector current is limited to about 2A by
	external resistors and currently I use 68% PWM limit, which should
	produce less than 1A hold current. So also current values seems to be
	in right magnitude.
	<p>
	I almost forget to mention that I also measured opening time of
	these injectors. It was 1.2ms at 12V voltage.
</blockquote></small></em>
<p>
One nice thing about them is they come with fuel line 'stubs' 
on their inlets, rather than the more usual automotive practice
of sealing to a fuel rail with O-rings.  This should make it
easy to connect them to the pump and regulator with EFI-rated T-pieces
and fuel line.
<p>
Now, the XLV should be making in the order of 45 kW.  The fuel
consumption rule-of-thumb seems to be "half a pound per horse per hour",
which would work out to 3.87 cc/min/kW, I think (better check that).
That'd be 174 cc/min, or about 48% duty cycle for two injectors.
Max duty cycle is generally ~ 80%, so that should hopefully be okay
and leave some room for power increase ... up to 75 kW (not that that's
likely out of the poor old beast :-) )
<p>
Of course, all this depends on fuel pressures, etc, so the first
thing I'll have to do once I get the drivers sorted is to flow
test them ...
